Task 6: Subqueries and Nested Queries
Internship Project â€“ SQL Developer at Elevate Labs
This task focuses on learning how to use subqueries and nested queries to perform advanced filtering and data analysis in SQL using the movie database.

What I Did :
Used the existing movie database created in previous tasks.
Practiced subqueries inside SELECT, WHERE, IN, EXISTS, and FROM clauses.
Wrote scalar and correlated subqueries to retrieve filtered and calculated data.
Simulated temporary tables using subqueries in FROM.

Key SQL Concepts Used :
Type of Subquery	Description
Subquery in SELECT -	Used to calculate values like actor count for each movie
Subquery in WHERE	  - Filters data using values returned from another query
Subquery with IN	  - Checks if a value exists in a list returned by another query
Correlated Subquery	- A subquery that references data from the outer query
Subquery in FROM	  -  Acts like a temporary table (a derived table) for calculations
EXISTS Subquery	     - Returns true if subquery returns any rows
