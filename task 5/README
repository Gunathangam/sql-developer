Task 5: SQL Joins (Inner, Left, Right, Full)

Internship Project ‚Äì SQL Developer at Elevate Labs

This task focuses on understanding and using different types of SQL **JOINS** to combine and analyze data across multiple related tables.

 üóÇÔ∏è What I Did

- Used the **movie database** created in earlier tasks.
- Applied various JOIN operations to combine data from:
  - `movies`
  - `actors`
  - `movie_actor`
  - `genres`
- Practiced different SQL JOIN types:
  - `INNER JOIN`
  - `LEFT JOIN`
  - `RIGHT JOIN`
  - `FULL OUTER JOIN` (simulated using `UNION` in MySQL)

 üîë Key SQL Concepts Used

| Join Type       | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `INNER JOIN`     | Returns rows when there is a match in both tables                          |
| `LEFT JOIN`      | Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right |
| `RIGHT JOIN`     | Returns all records from the right table and matched records from the left |
| `FULL OUTER JOIN`| Returns all records when there is a match in either table (simulated in MySQL) |
