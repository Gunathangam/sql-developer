🎯 Task 7: Creating Views
🧪 Internship Project – SQL Developer at Elevate Labs
This task focused on creating and using SQL views to simplify complex queries and support data abstraction in the movie database.

🗂️ What I Did :
Created views using the CREATE VIEW statement based on joined and grouped queries.

Queried views just like regular tables.

Demonstrated how views improve readability and reuse of logic.

Used views to show movies with genres, actors in each movie, and movie counts by genre.
