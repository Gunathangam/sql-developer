Task 3: Writing Basic SELECT Queries

Extract data using SELECT queries with WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT, and more.

Tools used:
- MySQL Workbench

What I learned:
- Retrieved all movie records
- Filtered movies by release year
- Used LIKE for pattern matching
- Sorted and limited results
- Joined movies and actors

Code:
`task3_select_queries.sql`: All SQL queries
