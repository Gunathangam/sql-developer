Task 8: Stored Procedures and Functions
Internship: SQL Developer at Elevate Labs
In this task, I learned how to create and use stored procedures and functions in MySQL. These are useful for reusing SQL code and organizing logic better.

What I Did :
Created a stored procedure to show movies from a specific genre.
Created a function to count how many actors are in a movie.
Used parameters in both to make them dynamic.
Ran the procedure using CALL and used the function inside a SELECT query.
